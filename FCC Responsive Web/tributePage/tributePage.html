          He was the chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), and co-founder of
          Apple Inc., the chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar, a member
          of The Walt Disney Company's board of directors following its
          acquisition of Pixar, and the founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT. Jobs
          is widely recognized as a pioneer of the personal computer revolution
          of the 1970s and 1980s, along with Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.

          Jobs and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's Apple I
          personal computer.

          Apple acquired NeXT in 1997, and Jobs became CEO of his former company
          within a few months.

          He worked closely with designer Jony Ive to develop a line of products
          that had larger cultural ramifications, beginning in 1997 with the
          "Think different" advertising campaign and leading to the iMac,
          iTunes, iTunes Store, Apple Store, iPod, iPhone, App Store, and the
          iPad. In 2001, the original Mac OS was replaced with a completely new
          Mac OS X, based on NeXT's NeXTSTEP platform, giving the OS a modern
          Unix-based foundation for the first time.

          Jobs was diagnosed with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor in 2003. He
          died of respiratory arrest related to the tumor at age 56 on October
          5, 2011.
